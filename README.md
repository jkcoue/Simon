This is a mini memory game created for the Tiva C Series LaunchPad and the Diligent Orbit Booster Pack. 

In this project, we used the microcontroller and the booster pack to imitate a hand-held gaming console.

The game was developed using the Arduino IDE with C.

Players will be given sequences of actions through the LED screen, where they must repeat the actions in the correct order to earn one point. Each turn, the length of the sequence increases, making the game more and more challenging.
